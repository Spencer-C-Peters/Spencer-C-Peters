## 👋 Hi, I'm Spencer Peters

🎓 Third-year Application Development student at **Varsity College** with a passion for building practical, meaningful software.

💻 I work primarily with **C#**, **Java**, **Kotlin**, and **XML**, and I enjoy creating applications that solve real-world problems.

🚀 My goal is to grow into a developer who not only writes clean, efficient code but also builds projects that make a genuine impact.

> 🧠 Always learning, always building — one project at a time.
